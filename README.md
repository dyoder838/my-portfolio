# **my-portfolio**

## **Description**
This is my portfolio - It is a continuing project to display and promote my web developer skills as I learn and grow.

My portfolio, thus far, is created primarily using bootstrap so that it will be mobile responsive. I added a custom CSS file to take care of some small style and layout issues.

I have also become a stickler for using semantic HTML and Semantic hooks wherever possible (bootstrap not included). 

As of 9/9/2020 it consists of 3 simple pages with an about me section, a contact me page, and a portfolio gallery with links to projects I have completed.
