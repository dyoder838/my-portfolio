# my-portfolio
this is my portfolio - it is a continuing project to display and promote my web developer skills as I learn and grow.

my portfolio, thus far, is created primarily using boot strap so that it will be mobile responsive. I added a custom CSS file to take care of some small style and layout issues.

I have also become a stickler for using semantic HTML and Semantic hooks wherever possible (bootstrap not included) 

as of 9/9/2020 it consists of 3 simple pages with an about me section, a contact me page, and a portfolio gallery. 

1) index.html is the About me page:

2) portfolio.html is my portfolio gallery
